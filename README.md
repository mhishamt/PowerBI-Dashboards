# PowerBI-Dashboards

# GlassDoor Dashboard
 I've created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard using a dataset that includes key information about job listings. The dataset contains columns such as Job Title, Salary Estimate, Job Description, Rating, Company Name, Location, Headquarters, Company Size, Founded Year, Type of Ownership, Industry, Sector, Revenue, and Competitors. Leveraging the power of Power BI's visualization capabilities, I've transformed this dataset into an interactive and insightful dashboard. With various visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables, this dashboard provides valuable insights into job market trends, company profiles, and salary estimates. Whether you're a job seeker, recruiter, or researcher, this Power BI dashboard is designed to help you make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the job landscape.
